# Sketch Milestones

## Source of truth
- Pinout text files in the repo root.
- README list should include every .txt file once.

## Milestones (recommended)
1) Inventory and README sync
   - Ensure every .txt is listed once in README.
   - Confirm each file includes a header and wiring diagram block.
2) Consistency pass
   - Standardize naming, spacing, and pin labeling across boards.
   - Normalize the used-pin marker convention.
3) Expansion
   - Add new board pinouts using the same header template.
   - Note additions in README.

## Notes
- This repository is documentation only; there is no compile step.
